Project Title: Animation of Insertion Sorting and Basic Operations in Doubly Linked Lists using Raylib in C

Project Context:
The project centers on developing an interactive visualization illustrating the insertion sort algorithm within a doubly linked list structure. This endeavor is a collaborative effort led by three students from ISIL B G4:Dziri Mohammed idir, Ramzi Gueracha Wassim and Meghni Aymen.

Project Scope:
The primary goal is to create a dynamic animation showcasing the functioning of the insertion sort algorithm in a doubly linked list. The emphasis will be on integrating fundamental operations of a doubly linked list alongside the insertion sorting algorithm.

Project Objectives:

Educational Tool: To create an educational tool aiding in the understanding of insertion sorting and DLLs visually.
Interactive Visualization: Provide an engaging graphical representation of insertion sorting, highlighting key steps and operations.
User Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface allowing users to control the animation, speed, and step through the sorting process.

Key Components:

Doubly Linked Lists (DLLs): Implementation of basic DLL operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Insertion Sort Algorithm: Developing an intuitive representation of insertion sorting within the DLL.
Raylib in C: Utilizing the Raylib library in the C programming language for graphical rendering and interactivity.

Team Members:
Dziri Mohammed Idir
Ramzi Gueracha Wassim 
Meghni Aymen

Outcomes:
The project outcome will be a functional application demonstrating the insertion sort algorithm's functionality within a DLL. It will serve as an educational aid and a resource for those learning about sorting algorithms and basic data structures.
